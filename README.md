# youtubemusic-lighttheme
A light theme for YouTube Music on web with a twist of the classic Google Play Music. This only overrides the styling of the site. It does not alter any functionality, that is not the intention of this.

# How to use it
1. Install the Stylus extension for Chrome (or a browser equivalent): https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en
2. Open YouTube Music and click the Stylus extension icon and click "Write new style for music.youtube.com" this should open a new tab/window with a tet editor
3. Copy the contents of output.css from this repo into this text editor and click Save/Ctrl + S.
4. You should see some changes immediately, but refresh the page for better results.
If you want to turn it off, click the Stylus extension icon and then "Turn all styles off".

Feel free to edit the styles to your liking, contribute with a pull request or raise an issue or do whatever the hell you like with it :)

# Future plans
Replace with SCSS for easier editing.
Possibly convert into a Chrome extension if there's enough interest.
